# CPT-dVMC calculation sample

</div>

This directory contains a direct application of the dVMC software usage to
compute the ground state of a small 3x4 cluster then using the Q-matrix
representation in cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to output the cluster
spectral function of the system by calling PyQCM library.

> ### Note

> It takes approximately 40 minutes to run [BÃ©luga](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en)

## Content

- `model_3x4.py`: Defines the lattice model using PyQCM library instances.

- `cluster_spectral.py`: Uses PyQCM dVMC interface to find the groundstate then
  CPT method to output the cluster spectral function of the system.

- `params`: Global dVMC solver input parameter file.

- `expected/`: Directory containing expected results from the CPT-dVMC calculations.

## Usage

Since this example uses dVMC through PyQCM, the only thing to do is to execute
the `cluster_spectral.py` script using Python 3 (with proper PyQCM installation)

#### Run script to generate cluster spectral function from CPT-dVMC

```shell
python3 cluster_spectral.py
```

## Post processing

To clean the directory from generated files that would be overwritten by the program,
use the `dvmc` command line interface

```shell
dvmc clean --help
```
